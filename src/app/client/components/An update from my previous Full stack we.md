An update from my previous Full stack web application (Billing/Invoice software). Apparently the core function of the app was to generate invoice on basis of stored data; display and manipulate them..However a new road block came in the way when the client's requirement was to get a designed professional looking invoice in pdf format...This is were I had to bang my head scraping the net for resources because I could not think of any programmer spending time on coding and structuring a pdf looking like a bill recepit...

And finally I had to make my way with jsPDf (node library)..and trust me..the process was excruciating and frustrating..people having experience in 3d/2D game making would understand..each line had to co-ordinated and place..there were no extra tools...and finally I came up with the end result after creating 400+ pdfs...

PS: don't bother with Chat gpt/AI tools..it just elongated my dev time in this scenario..
